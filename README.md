# DailyWorkSchedule_JS
## Description
- The scope of this assignment was to create a daily work planner that updates clock in real time as well as highlight time blocks based on their time period.
- This project shows how much Javascript is able to do in manipulating multiple elements and taking in additional resources such as Bootstrap, JQuery, and Moment.js.
- The issue that gave me the most difficulty was that of local storage.  I was able to attain contact with local storage and even save multiple tasks, but had extreme difficulty in getting them to render back to the display in their corresponding time-blocks.  
- I have learned a good amount of how JQuery can do some of the leg work in traversing the DOM as well as how Bootstrap can quickly roughly style a page based on a few universal classes.  Moment.js is also a great tool for working with anything related to time.
